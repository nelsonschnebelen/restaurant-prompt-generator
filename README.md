## 💡 Pro Tips

### A/B Testing
Generate multiple variations by changing presets or lighting. Test which images drive better CTR and conversions.

### Platform-Specific Strategy
- **Meta**: Use Scroll-Stopper or Social Viral presets
- **Google**: Use Conversion Driver or Premium Positioning
- **Delivery**: Use Craving Creator preset

### Midjourney Workflow
1. Use V1-V4 buttons to explore variations
2. Use "Upscale Subtle" for final refinement
3. Avoid "Upscale Creative" - it can over-process food photos

### Text Overlay Planning
Always check "Space for Text" options if you're adding copy to ads. Images with dedicated text zones perform 3x better.
